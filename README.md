# leetcode
this repository is for uploading all my leetcode problem submissions.  
## Notice
I decided to stop using Leethub plguin since It makes too many commits and it doesn't seem to be fixed. 
Anyway I'll keep solving leetcode problems, You can check it out if you want to https://leetcode.com/Shane-Park/

### Intro
I usually do the daily challenge but sometimes i solve other problems when I get bored or have some time.  
Any feedback about my submissions would be really appreciated.  
If you're interested in problem solving but have no idea what or how to start, just let me know i'll share my idea. it's actually fun. 
### Leethub
Thanks to [Leethub](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub), I don't need to care about backing up code since it does automatically for me.  
If you're interested in leethub please check it out.
